Attached are a simulated count map cube and exposure map cube for an NFW 
profile with a one year Fermi observation.  I used the same dark matter 
model as before but required a similar total gamma-ray flux, which just 
pumps up the annihilation cross-section.  This way the statistics should 
be good enough.

Here are the NFW parameters:
r0 = 20 kpc
rho_loc = 0.3 GeV/cm^3
r_sun = 8 kpc
(alpha,beta,gamma) = (1,3,1)
