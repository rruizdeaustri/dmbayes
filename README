- The IRFs verison is setup in the ini file
 
- The number of pixels to convolve is set in the ini file.
 What is the diff. between GC_outerPix and GC_corePix ?

- Data are giving in fits format but I don't understand. The 
data fix everything

- What are the data in the sim (down)

- The routine for syntetic data is called Initialize_Synthetic data 
 and for PS is called Fermi_InitPtSrc in fermi_ini. There I have add a goto 
 to add mick PSs by hand !!!!

- The GC ROI is from -7.5 to 7.5: The energy limits for Ps is from 1 GeV to 100 GeV in the catalog 

- But in the code are hardcored Ebottom and Etop ??? These are used 
for the integrated flux.

- Everything in terms of pixels, energy bins are given by the inits obs 
file (readDM). Number of pixels is an input and the size is fixed (0.25)


- Where/how are/go the observations ?
 
*******************************

- There is also the generation of mock data for the backgrounds associated 
with the 3 grid point of the templates (fermi_initbg)
