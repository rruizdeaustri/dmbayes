PyPolyChord Readme
==================

This is very much a beta-testing version of a python interface. Interfaces are liable to change with each release.

It has been tested on an ubuntu 14.0 installation with gfortran. Any feedback/bug fixes welcome.

Prerequisites
-------------
f2py :  https://sysbio.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/#prerequisites

Installation
------------
Run these commands:

$ make veryclean
$ make MPI= libchord.so
$ make pypolychord.so
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD'/src/':$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The last command is essential, otherwise python cannot find libchord.so 

Running
-------
Try running the demo script:
$ python pypolychord/demo_gaussian.py

This script can be modified to fit your purposes
