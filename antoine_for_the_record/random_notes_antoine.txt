A FEW THINGS...
-------
Remember to change nestwrap.f90 around line 111 in the future for 10D background scans (see !CS comment)
-------
To be able to run Diver, population size NP has to be a multiple of both the number of point sources and the number of mpi processes
-------
To be able to compile GetPlots, add fermi_ptsrc.o to (PLOTFILES) in the Makefile on the svn
-------
There is a problem with system call in driver.f90 on HPC with mpif90... Does not impact Multinest and Driver though.

Follow up files :

27modes_above_nullev.txt : 4 of the 31 modes found by MN RunI were dismissed by Null evidence : THE ONE WHICH IS USED IN MY RUNS.
46PSafterMNRunIallmodes.txt : all 31 modes are kept for follow up in this one

******Code modifications******
Slightly changed the way to include mock point sources in fermi_ini.f90 to make it look more clear

Changed GC_BG interpolation into a function stored in fermi_ini.f90 - also INTERPOLATION and INTERPOLATION1D subroutines have been moved to fermi_ini.f90 since they were needed by my GC_BG_map_rescaled function.

hardcoded point sources found by MN first run and fitted by Diver first run to include them in the model for MN second run (now commented)

changed diverwrap.f90 (line160 thereabout) so as to help individuals fall into allowed l,b range : points ouside the range no longer have all LogLike=LogZero but LogLike = LogZero*(1 + distance from allowed square in l,b space)
**********

Added a few test maps of the new BG function in for_the_record/figures/BG_function_tests/ : Data map with the new function for BG and with the old way of doing it, to check I have the same;  Model map when hardcoding the 26 point sources fitted by Diver, and a BG map when varying the BG parameters in the function, to check I have something different (more important background here, as I modified the BG parameters in order to increase the flux.)
